The client was a small business trying to start an online way to have students sign up and take driving classes.
They needed the entire website and back end connection designed.

I feel like I had a clear vision in mind which helped with some of the desing process.

I would go back and rework the diagrams as they are lacking in various spots. Although they fulfill the functions they need to, they can definitely be made more robust.

Designing the interface and some functionality was based around the clients needs. It is important to implement the user needs so that using the website is an enjoyable experience that assists the business in keeping their clients.

I have found that designing software is a mix between adequate planning and prep while maintaining flexibility so that you have room to make changes while developing in an agile approach.
